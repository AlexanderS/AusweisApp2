    <!-- Class is not registered in the manifest.

        Activities, services and content providers should be registered in the
        AndroidManifest.xml file using <activity>, <service> and <provider> tags.

        If your activity is simply a parent class intended to be subclassed
        by other "real" activities, make it an abstract class.

        We can not make the classes abstract, because Qt provides
        it and it should be possible to use it without subclassing.

    <!-- Unused Exported service does not require permission.

         Exported services (services which either set exported=true or contain
         an intent-filter and do not specify exported=false) should define a
         permission that an entity must have in order to launch the service or
         bind to it. Without this, any application can use this service.

         We decided to ignore this warning because we do not want to limit the
         access to the service. Any application should be able to use the
         service without additional barriers.
